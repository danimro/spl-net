SPL3-Server

Server Part of client-server project from the course "Systems Programming" of Ben-Gurion University.
The project was to build a "social network" using two kinds of server architectures:
A. Thread Per Client (TPC)
B. Reactor Server.

The Server (Both of them) is written in Java, and the Client side is written in C++ using Boost

(The client side project can be found here https://github.com/yodatk/Boost_Echo_Client )
